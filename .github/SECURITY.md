## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/your-username/gitDM/security/advisories/new)
3. Or email us directly at: [your-email@example.com] (if you prefer email)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24-48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues will be addressed within 7 days, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing

### Security Best Practices

When using this project:

1. **Environment Variables**: Keep sensitive configuration in environment variables, never in code
2. **Authentication**: Use strong, unique passwords and enable 2FA where possible
3. **Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date using Dependabot or manual updates
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
5. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
6. **Database Security**: Use encrypted connections and follow database security best practices

### Known Security Considerations

- This project handles medical data - ensure HIPAA compliance if applicable
- JWT tokens should be securely stored and have appropriate expiration times
- AI/ML endpoints may be subject to injection attacks - validate all inputs
- Audit logs contain sensitive information - secure access appropriately
